        Just the few words describing who I am, what I like to do.
    About Me
        More detailed description of my school (mb&b major turned to CS halfway through after realizing needed to create more?) Studied abroad at AIT. Brief description of what kinds of projects I like to do (in general), some I’ve worked on in the past, and maybe current and previous job stuff/lab
    Skills:
        Programming Languages:  
            Python, Java, SMLNJ, Javascript, ..., some experience
            with Objective C, C++.
        Web Technologies (or something):
            HTML, CSS, Responsive Design, Django, Flask, NodeJS, Amazon Services, very familiar with Google Maps API (and many others.. lawl this might be weird to say)
        Familiar with agile development?
    Work Experience/CV (attach)
        Current stuff, link to giovanni website
            I'm implementing the front-end and back-end for 
            a feature that would allow users to upload and manage geographical files that the users can submit to Giovanni for automated analysis over the region defined in the particular file.
        NIH stuff, link to array tomography
            Automated a process for Array tomography, a __. As a result, the entire software analysis process of AT is now entirely opensource. 
        Fred lab, link to Fred lab (and briefly what I worked on in a general-ish way)
    Projects
        SimplestEver?
        Circadian
        Leah’s site
        WikiMaps!
        WesApp? (Under development..)
    Fun stuff
        Origami (duh)
        Other photos
        Maybe use the same sort of image viewer from Leah’s site and display some (more..) photos, then maybe put up a few other photos?
